				  <h2>The Midsummer King</h2>
				  I know you-<br>
You who journeyed long in staggered step<br>
To bury your heart in a tomb of faltering pride-<br>
You who torched the gleaming mountain pass<br>
In pentecostal fire, outshone the sun of June,<br>
Then took the exile of a broken king in July.<br>
Now in the sere summer heat,<br>
Did you tread back through this broken land?<br>
And give up the dream that blossomed in youth<br>
As the warning-song for a lesser man?<br>
Summon what gods may save you now,<br>
And pray the angels watch in their steadfast wiles.<br>
Did Napoleon ever turn his back<br>
To the Seraphim that, for him, meekly smiled?<br>
No, the flaming rock of Corsica in golden evening<br>
Must have burnt like the seat of Armageddon<br>
As he swore to put out the sun in glory<br>
Or, if not, boldly claim the kingdom of Heaven.<br>
So the dew gathers swiftly on your brow<br>
From the grass where the fallen heroes wept.<br>
They sing their war-songs songs as pallid flowers<br>
With roots too short to stay the season,<br>
Too weak to call their death triumphant, too fickle to mark <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; the arid plain defeated.<br>
I will not watch you join them,<br>
You for whom the stars of glowing nights gave way.<br>
The stems that bore the greats of old blossom upon your knee<br>
And through new hills resound and blaze.<br>
The angel's names are written here,<br>
Their stone-carved words reminding<br>
They too limped through the valley of defeat<br>
And ventured on in twilight.<br>

<br> <br><br><br>
				<h2>One Thousand Love Letters<br> to Everyone I've Ever Met</h2>
				Because you gave me yourself,<br>
I have nothing else to give you.<br>
And because I carry only you with me,<br>
Take this poem,<br>
Because it is yours, and it is you.<br>
<br><br>
Tonight I sit at the table <br>
You never graced, where<br>
None I know ever came. <br>
And among strange voices, <br>
I talk in your voice<br>
Of whispers muttered through the door,<br>
Watching our youth pass<br>
In a rave of forgotten joy.<br>
Now when I speak alone, <br>
I sing you-<br>
Your many voices all shining,<br>
Reflected the chorus of memory,<br>
Assimilated in moments long forgot.<br>
<br><br>
So if I don't see you,<br>
Read this in your own words,<br>
In your own room, <br>
Where you took me once<br>
To plant roots beyond the walls of my self.<br>
Some nights I return there smiling<br>
To see that trellis in bloom,<br>
With your shifting mind<br>
Shining in each wisteria-bud.<br>

And if you don't remember me,<br>
I’ll remember you,<br>
Standing in scrubs blue as warm oceans,<br>
Washing me down the vista of years<br>
To when you taught me to smile in a nursing-bed.<br>
These innumerable gifts<br>
You've spoiled me with,<br>
Suffering anemic in photographs,<br>
Awaking tall or short<br>
In far-away beds,<br>
Bounding human perception<br>
By the change of weak glance,<br>
Like a child in a passing car.<br>
<br><br>
When the taxis flicker through the fog,<br>
I look for your gaze.<br>
But even as I watch them into the sunshine,<br>
You sit by my side and think my thoughts for me,<br>
Admiring the colored light-shafts,<br>
The graceful dew reflecting;<br>
And when the sun breaks,<br>
The daylight is shrouded with fears<br>
Of isolation or impermanence,<br>
And of spiders bigger than your thumbnail.<br>
So I smile to know<br>
These agonies were first yours, long ago.<br>
Now they are just the contrast to<br>
your dreams, my dreams.<br>
From these top boughs<br>
Growing young from my tree of life,<br>
I admire the forest you planted here,<br>
Even the branches that turn,<br>
And the vines that block my way.<br>

Read this poem and forget every word.<br>
Drown each syllable in your life,<br>
Verse for broken verse dissolved<br>
In the cool blood of countless veins-<br>
Returned like a library book into<br>
The throbs of your beating heart.<br>
<br><br>
Please be well. I love you.<br>

<br> <br><br><br>
<h2>Admiring Sargent</h2>
Bob your hair with twelve French pins<br>
And glitter your eyes with a half stopped tear–<br>
Light the candelabra from the windowsill <br>
To dissolve into the smoke and disappear.<br>
Why do you weep in this realm of gold?<br>
<br><br>
Tell me what to say to wisp anxieties away.<br>
No furs you drape or jewels you shine<br>
Warp the loathing in your eyes.<br>
You may make me viceroy<br>
Sitting in my blackwood chair,<br>
And call my daughter from the frey<br>
To burnish like a house-servant your thinning hair.<br>
<br><br>
She turned away and blew the candles too,<br>
Then there was no threshold <br>
Between the deepest sky and darkened room.<br>
And through that door she scurried in step,<br>
Only the marble busts reflecting the dress<br>
As pure as hatred, thin as breath,<br>
Stained with tears falling through realms of gold.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
